The aim of this project was to create a program to play battleship game on two terminals
which communicate with signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.

Build the binary thanks to the Makefile and then you can :
- Launch the game : ./navy maps/{file}
- Connect the enemy on a second terminal : ./navy [first_play_pid] maps/{file}
- Get some help : ./navy -h
